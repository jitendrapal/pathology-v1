# 🔧 **Test Search Fixes & Custom Amounts Removal**

## ✅ **COMPLETED: Fixed Test Search and Removed Custom Amounts**

I've successfully fixed the test search functionality and confirmed that the Additional Charges & Custom Amounts section has been completely removed!

---

## 🛠️ **Issue 1: Fixed Test Search Not Showing Values**

### **❌ The Problem:**
```
- Test search box not showing suggestions when typing
- Event listeners not properly attached
- Complex event management causing conflicts
```

### **✅ The Solution:**
```
- Simplified event listener management
- Removed complex cloning approach
- Added direct event listeners with debugging
- Ensured proper initialization timing
```

### **✅ What I Fixed:**
```javascript
// Before: Complex event management (PROBLEMATIC)
const newSearchInput = searchInput.cloneNode(true);
searchInput.parentNode.replaceChild(newSearchInput, searchInput);
newSearchInput.addEventListener('input', performTestSearch);

// After: Simple direct listeners (WORKS)
searchInput.addEventListener('input', function(e) {
    console.log('Input event triggered:', e.target.value);
    performTestSearch(e.target.value);
});
```
